# FullStack
Beginning at the most basic of full stack development - and gradually adding and exploring more features. The code will include -
  * HTML and CSS
  * JavaScript
  * jQuery (Basically a large JavaScript library, making things easier and more manageable)
  * Python
  * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python based open-source web framework)
Below is a short summary of each directory in this repo. Each directory contains files related to a single application.

1. #### SampleSignUp
  * Contains a very basic application, showing a sample sign up page, which re-directs to a 'thank you' page on successful detail submission.

2. #### TicTacToe
