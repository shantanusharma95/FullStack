# FullStack
Beginning at the most basic of full stack development - and gradually adding and exploring more features. The code will include -
  * HTML and CSS
  * JavaScript
  * jQuery (Basically a large JavaScript library, making things easier and more manageable)
  * Python
  * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python based open-source web framework)
