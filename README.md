# FullStack
Beginning at the most basic of full stack development - and gradually adding and exploring more features. The code will include -
  * HTML and CSS
  * JavaScript
  * jQuery (Basically a large JavaScript library, making things easier and more manageable)
  * Python
  * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python based open-source web framework)
Below is a short summary of each directory in this repo. Each directory contains files related to a single application.

1. #### SampleSignUp
 Contains a very basic application, showing a sample sign up page, which re-directs to a 'thank you' page on successful detail submission.

2. #### TicTacToe
 This is a tic tac toe game replica. Created with basic html and css - but here I have used DOM in the .js file, to interact with the HTML elements.
 
 DOM (document object model) is like an interface that allows JavaScript to work with the HTML and CSS elements
